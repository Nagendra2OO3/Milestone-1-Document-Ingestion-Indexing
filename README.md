# Milestone 1 – Document Ingestion & Indexing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a document ingestion and indexing pipeline. It processes documents by loading them from a directory, splitting them into smaller chunks, generating vector embeddings using a HuggingFace model, and storing the embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
