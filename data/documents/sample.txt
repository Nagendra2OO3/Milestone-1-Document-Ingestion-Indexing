Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on building intelligent systems
capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

AI systems can understand natural language, recognize images, analyze large volumes of data,
and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Document processing is an important application of AI.
By converting documents into embeddings and storing them in vector databases,
AI systems can perform semantic search and retrieve relevant information efficiently.

This project focuses on building a document ingestion and indexing pipeline
that prepares documents for AI-powered search and question answering.
